        <p>Pattern synonyms are a great feature.</p>
<p>It is common to define closed data types. Later if one wants to annotate their syntax tree or pass along any other additional information this can cause significant problems. A clean solution is to redefine the data type using open recursion and then taking the fixed point.<a href="#fn1" class="footnoteRef" id="fnref1"><sup>1</sup></a> This approach allows great flexibility and access to uniform <a href="http://hackage.haskell.org/package/recursion-schemes">recursion schemes</a> but used to come at a cost. If the library writer had exposed the constructors, all existing user code would break with these changes. Since GHC 7.10, patterns allow us to completely swap out the underlying data type whilst maintaining the original interface.</p>

        <p>Thanks to the work of Jesse Rosenthal, pandoc has recently become capable of reading docx documents. This additional functional now makes it extremely easy to diff two docx files without any additional tools.</p>
