    <span class="title"> Pattern Synonyms in GHC 8.0 </span>
    <span class="info"> December 12, 2015 </span>
     
        <p>There have been four small but significant improvements to pattern synonyms which are going to appear in GHC 8.0.</p>
<p>This work closes up some holes which were left in the implementation of pattern synonyms and should provide library authors with a new and flexible method of abstraction.</p>
<p>More information about pattern synonyms can be found in the <a href="http://mpickering.github.io/users_guide/glasgow_exts.html#pattern-synonyms">GHC 8.0 user guide</a>.</p>

        <p>Users upgrading to <a href="https://hackage.haskell.org/package/hlint-1.9.23">hlint 1.9.23</a> will now be able to take advantage of the new <code>--refactor</code> flag which by invoking the <code>refactor</code> executable supplied by <a href="https://hackage.haskell.org/package/apply-refact-0.1.0.0"><code>apply-refact</code></a> can automatically apply suggestions.</p>

    <span class="title"> Announcing ghc-exactprint: A New Foundation For Refactoring Tools </span>
    <span class="info"> July 23, 2015 </span>
     
        <p>Over the last few months Alan Zimmerman and myself have been working on what will hopefully become a new foundation for refactoring Haskell programs. We have called this foundation <code>ghc-exactprint</code> and it is now available on <a href="https://hackage.haskell.org/package/ghc-exactprint">hackage</a> to coincide with the release of GHC 7.10.2.</p>
<p>Thompson and Reinke originally described 22 refactorings in their <a href="http://www.cs.kent.ac.uk/projects/refactor-fp/publications/refactoring-draft-catalogue.pdf">catalogue</a> of functional refactorings which motivated the development of HaRe. Missing from their list is the identity transformation, in the context of refactoring this is perhaps the most important. When applying any kind of change to small segment of your project it is undesirable for the tooling to modify another part of your file unexpectedly. The identity refactoring seems to be the easiest of all but it is important that any refactoring tool behaves in this way.</p>
<p>The biggest challenge of the last few months was being able to perform the identity refactoring whilst retaining a suitable representation to be able to easily transform programs. Now that we believe that <code>ghc-exactprint</code> is robust, the challenge is to build the promised refactoring tools upon it.</p>

    <span class="title"> Data Types à la Carte with Closed Type Families </span>
    <span class="info"> December 20, 2014 </span>
     
        <p>By hitting that critical sweet spot of solving an interesting problem and having a catchy name, most know, if not understand Wouter Swierstra’s data types à la carte.</p>
<p>As the name suggests, the à la carte approach involves composing together data types to form bigger, <em>custom</em> types along with functions where we can precisely specify the necessary pieces. The approach relies heavily on a clever trick with type classes which is reviewed below. With more modern GHC extensions, the implementation can be made much more explicit, this is what this post will explore.</p>
<p>For a general overview of the approach there is no better introduction than the original <a href="http://citeseerx.ist.psu.edu/viewdoc/summary?doi=10.1.1.101.4131">functional pearl</a>.</p>

    <span class="title"> Pain Free Unfix with Pattern Synonyms </span>
    <span class="info"> November 27, 2014 </span>
     
        <p>Pattern synonyms are a great feature.</p>
<p>It is common to define closed data types. Later if one wants to annotate their syntax tree or pass along any other additional information this can cause significant problems. A clean solution is to redefine the data type using open recursion and then taking the fixed point.<a href="#fn1" class="footnoteRef" id="fnref1"><sup>1</sup></a> This approach allows great flexibility and access to uniform <a href="http://hackage.haskell.org/package/recursion-schemes">recursion schemes</a> but used to come at a cost. If the library writer had exposed the constructors, all existing user code would break with these changes. Since GHC 7.10, patterns allow us to completely swap out the underlying data type whilst maintaining the original interface.</p>
