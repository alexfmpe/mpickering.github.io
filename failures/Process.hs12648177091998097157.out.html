Light-weight sample parameter inference which will fit most needs.
We only do \"poor man's inference\", only for sample rates.
The sample rate will be provided as an argument of a special type 'T'.
This argument will almost never be passed explicitly
but should be handled by operators analogous to '($)' and '(.)'.

In contrast to the run-time inference approach,
we have the static guarantee that the sample rate is fixed
before passing a signal to the outside world.
However we still need to make it safe that signals
that are rendered for one sample rate
are not processed with another sample rate.

This wraps a function which computes a sample rate dependent result.
Sample rate tells how many values per unit are stored
for representation of a signal.

The process is labeled with a type variable @s@ which is part the signals.
This way we can ensure that signals are only used
with the sample rate they are created for.
