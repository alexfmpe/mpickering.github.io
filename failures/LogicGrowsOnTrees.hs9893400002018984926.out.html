{- $types
The following are the tree types that are accepted by most of the functions in
this package. You do not need to know the details of their definitions unless
you intend to write your own custom routines for running and transforming trees,
in which case the relevant information is at the bottom of this page in the
Implementation section.

There is one type of pure tree and two types of impure trees. In general, your
tree should nearly always be pure if you are planning to make use of
checkpointing or parallel exploring, as parts of the tree may be explored
multiple times, some parts may not be run at all on a given processor, and
whenever a leaf is hit there will be a jump to a higher node, so if your tree is
impure then the result needs to not depend on how the tree is explored; an
example of an acceptable use of an inner monad is when you want to memoize a
pure function using a stateful monad.

If you need something like state in your tree, then you should consider
nesting the tree monad in the state monad rather than vice-versa,
because this will do things like automatically erasing the change in state that
happened between an inner node and a leaf when the tree jumps back up
from the leaf to an inner node, which will usually be what you want.
-}

{-| A pure tree, which is what you should normally be using. -}
type Tree = TreeT Identity

{-| A tree running in the I/O monad, which you should only be using for doing
    things like reading data from an external file or database that will be
    constant for the entire run.
-}
type TreeIO = TreeT IO

{-| A tree run in an arbitrary monad. -}
newtype TreeT m α = TreeT { unwrapTreeT :: ProgramT (TreeTInstruction m) m α }

--------------------------------- Type-classes ---------------------------------
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

{- $type-classes

'Tree's are instances of 'MonadExplorable' and 'MonadExplorableTrans',
which are both subclasses of 'MonadPlus'. The additional functionality offered
by these type-classes is the ability to cache results so that a computation does
not need to be repeated when a node is explored a second time, which can happen
either when resuming from a checkpoint or when a workload has been stolen by
another processor, as the first step is to retrace the path through the tree
that leads to the stolen workload.

These features could have been provided as functions, but there are two reasons
why they were subsumed into type-classes: first, because one might want to
add another layer above the 'Tree' monad transformers in the monad stack
(as is the case in "LogicGrowsOnTrees.Location"), and second, because one might want
to run a tree using a simpler monad such as List for testing purposes.

NOTE:  Caching a computation takes space in the 'Checkpoint', so it is something
       you should only do when the result is relatively small and the
       computation is very expensive and is high enough in the search tree that
       it is likely to be repeated often.  If the calculation is low enough in
       the search tree that it is unlikely to be repeated, is cheap enough so
       that repeating it is not a big deal, or produces a result with an
       incredibly large memory footprint, then you are probably better off not
       caching the result.
 -}

{-| The 'MonadExplorable' class provides caching functionality when exploring a
    tree, as well as a way to give a worker a chance to process any pending
    requests; at minimum 'cacheMaybe' needs to be defined.
 -}
class MonadPlus m ⇒ MonadExplorable m where
    {-| Cache a value in case we explore this node again. -}
    cache :: Serialize x ⇒ x → m x
    cache = cacheMaybe . Just

    {-| This does the same thing as 'guard' but it caches the result. -}
    cacheGuard :: Bool → m ()
    cacheGuard = cacheMaybe . (\x → if x then Just () else Nothing)

    {-| This function is a combination of the previous two;  it performs a
        computation which might fail by returning 'Nothing', and if that happens
        it then backtracks; if it passes then the result is cached and returned.

        Note that the previous two methods are essentially specializations of
        this method.
     -}
    cacheMaybe :: Serialize x ⇒ Maybe x → m x

    {-| This function tells the worker to take a break to process any pending
        requests; it does nothing if we are not in a parallel setting.

        NOTE: You should normally never need to use this function, as requests
        are processed whenever a choice point, a cache point, mzero, or a leaf
        in the decision tree has been encountered. However, if you have noticed
        that workload steals are taking such a large amount of time that workers
        are spending too much time sitting idle while they wait for a workload,
        and you can trace this as being due to a computation that takes so much
        time that it almost never gives the worker a chance to process requests,
        then you can use this method to ensure that requests are given a chance
        to be processed.

{- $functions

in various ways, functions that make it easier to build trees, and a function
that changes the base monad of a pure tree.

---------------------------------- Explorers -----------------------------------

{- $runners
The following functions all take a tree as input and produce the result of
exploring it as output. There are seven functions because there are two kinds of
trees --- pure and impure --- and three ways of exploring a tree --- exploring
everything and summing all results (i.e., in the leaves), exploring until the
first result (i.e., in a leaf) is encountered and immediately returning, and
gathering results (i.e., from the leaves) until they satisfy a condition and
then returning --- plus a seventh function that explores a tree only for the
side-effects.

specifically it uses the @operational@ package. The idea is that a list of
instructions are provided in 'TreeTInstruction', and then the operational monad
does all the heavy lifting of turning them into a monad.

{-| The core of the implementation of 'Tree' is mostly contained in this

    choices, 'Null', which indicates that there are no more results, and
    'ProcessPendingRequests', which signals that a break should be taken from
    exploration to process any pending requests (only meant to be used in
    exceptional cases).

{- $types
The following are the tree types that are accepted by most of the functions in
this package. You do not need to know the details of their definitions unless
you intend to write your own custom routines for running and transforming trees,
in which case the relevant information is at the bottom of this page in the
Implementation section.

There is one type of pure tree and two types of impure trees. In general, your
tree should nearly always be pure if you are planning to make use of
checkpointing or parallel exploring, as parts of the tree may be explored
multiple times, some parts may not be run at all on a given processor, and
whenever a leaf is hit there will be a jump to a higher node, so if your tree is
impure then the result needs to not depend on how the tree is explored; an
example of an acceptable use of an inner monad is when you want to memoize a
pure function using a stateful monad.

If you need something like state in your tree, then you should consider
nesting the tree monad in the state monad rather than vice-versa,
because this will do things like automatically erasing the change in state that
happened between an inner node and a leaf when the tree jumps back up
from the leaf to an inner node, which will usually be what you want.

{-| A pure tree, which is what you should normally be using. -}
type Tree = TreeT Identity

{-| A tree running in the I/O monad, which you should only be using for doing
    things like reading data from an external file or database that will be
    constant for the entire run.
-}
type TreeIO = TreeT IO

--------------------------------- Type-classes ---------------------------------
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

{- $type-classes

'Tree's are instances of 'MonadExplorable' and 'MonadExplorableTrans',
which are both subclasses of 'MonadPlus'. The additional functionality offered
by these type-classes is the ability to cache results so that a computation does
not need to be repeated when a node is explored a second time, which can happen
either when resuming from a checkpoint or when a workload has been stolen by
another processor, as the first step is to retrace the path through the tree
that leads to the stolen workload.

These features could have been provided as functions, but there are two reasons
why they were subsumed into type-classes: first, because one might want to
add another layer above the 'Tree' monad transformers in the monad stack
(as is the case in "LogicGrowsOnTrees.Location"), and second, because one might want
to run a tree using a simpler monad such as List for testing purposes.

NOTE:  Caching a computation takes space in the 'Checkpoint', so it is something
       you should only do when the result is relatively small and the
       computation is very expensive and is high enough in the search tree that
       it is likely to be repeated often.  If the calculation is low enough in
       the search tree that it is unlikely to be repeated, is cheap enough so
       that repeating it is not a big deal, or produces a result with an
       incredibly large memory footprint, then you are probably better off not
       caching the result.
 -}

{-| The 'MonadExplorable' class provides caching functionality when exploring a
    tree, as well as a way to give a worker a chance to process any pending
    requests; at minimum 'cacheMaybe' needs to be defined.
 -}
class MonadPlus m => MonadExplorable m where
    {-| Cache a value in case we explore this node again. -}
    cache :: Serialize x => x -> m x
    cache = cacheMaybe . Just

    {-| This does the same thing as 'guard' but it caches the result. -}
    cacheGuard :: Bool -> m ()
    cacheGuard = cacheMaybe . (\x -> if x then Just () else Nothing)

    {-| This function is a combination of the previous two;  it performs a
        computation which might fail by returning 'Nothing', and if that happens
        it then backtracks; if it passes then the result is cached and returned.

        Note that the previous two methods are essentially specializations of
        this method.
     -}
    cacheMaybe :: Serialize x => Maybe x -> m x

    {-| This function tells the worker to take a break to process any pending
        requests; it does nothing if we are not in a parallel setting.

        NOTE: You should normally never need to use this function, as requests
        are processed whenever a choice point, a cache point, mzero, or a leaf
        in the decision tree has been encountered. However, if you have noticed
        that workload steals are taking such a large amount of time that workers
        are spending too much time sitting idle while they wait for a workload,
        and you can trace this as being due to a computation that takes so much
        time that it almost never gives the worker a chance to process requests,
        then you can use this method to ensure that requests are given a chance
        to be processed.

gathering results (i.e., from the leaves) until they satisfy a condition and
then returning --- plus a seventh function that explores a tree only for the

{- $implementation
The implementation of the 'Tree' types uses the approach described in \"The
Operational Monad Tutorial\", published in
<http://themonadreader.wordpress.com/ Issue 15 of The Monad.Reader>;
specifically it uses the @operational@ package. The idea is that a list of
instructions are provided in 'TreeTInstruction', and then the operational monad
does all the heavy lifting of turning them into a monad.
 -}

{-| The core of the implementation of 'Tree' is mostly contained in this
    type, which provides a list of primitive instructions for trees:
    'Cache', which caches a value, 'Choice', which signals a branch with two
    choices, 'Null', which indicates that there are no more results, and
    'ProcessPendingRequests', which signals that a break should be taken from
