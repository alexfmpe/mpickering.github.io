-- creation of broadcast channels without the space-leaks that may arise from
-- using 'Control.Concurrent.Chan.dupChan'.
--
-- The 'Control.Concurrent.Chan.Chan' type from "Control.Concurrent.Chan"
-- consists of both a read and write end. This presents a problem when one
-- wants to have a broadcast channel that, at times, has zero listeners. To
-- write to a 'Control.Concurrent.Chan.Chan' there must always be a read end
-- and this read end will hold ALL messages alive until read.
--
-- The simple solution applied in this module is to separate read and write
-- ends. As a result, any messages written to the write end can be immediately
-- garbage collected if there are no active read ends, avoding space leaks.
