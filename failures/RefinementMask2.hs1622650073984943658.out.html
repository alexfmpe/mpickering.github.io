This function interprets all monomials as truncated power functions,
that is power functions that are set to zero for negative arguments.
However the convolution implied by this interpretation
cannot be represented by means of mask convolution.
See for instance:

*MathObj.RefinementMask2> fromPolynomial $ convolvePolynomial2 x x
RefinementMask2.fromCoeffs [1 % 3,-1 % 8,-1 % 8,1 % 24]

The obtained mask cannot be factored,
thus it is not a complete square.
But maybe it becomes a square if we add u*(-1,1)^4.
However this mask has sum 1/8 and the added term has sum 0,
thus the sum of the modified mask is still 1/8 and thus not a square.
