 You can specify the embed string by @-optF@. The default embed
 string is "$" . Expressions in parenthesis that immediately follow
 the embed strings are treated as embed expression. Embed
 expressions are evaluated in the context of the module. The result
 should be of type string.

 Please look at the source code of this module for an usecase of
 @embeddock@.

 At the moment, embeddock is not compatible with one-liner comment "--"
 due to the backend lexer.
