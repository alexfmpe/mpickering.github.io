{- | Flexible records with named fields.

Named records allow you to define und use records
with labeled fields. These records are first class
objects. Record fields are labeled by names, which
can basically be any type. However, the names package
provides global name types and some syntactic sugar
to use them.

Here is a complete walk-through, with Template Haskell
syntactic sugar.

This is how a typical example preamble looks like:

> import Data.NamedRecord

In order to use names you need to declare them first
(see the @names@ package for further details):

> name "firstName"
> name "lastName"

These are two records @Person@ and @User@:

> record "Person"
>     `has` "firstName" := ''String
>     `has` "lastName"  := ''String
>
> record "User"
>     `has` "firstName" := ''String
>     `has` "lastName"  := ''String
>     `has` "loginName" := ''String

Note that these declarations create constructor
functions @newPerson@ and @newUser@, as well as
type synonyms @Person@ and @User@ (use @-ddump-splices@
to see what has been generated).

Here are two instances of these recors:

> julian = newPerson
>    `set` firstName := "Julian"
>    `set` lastName  := "Fleischer"
>
> alexander = newUser
>    `set` firstName := "Alexander"
>    `set` lastName  := "Carnicero"
>    `set` loginName := "alexander.carnicero"

We can now create a @displayName@ function like
the following:

> displayName obj =
>     (obj `get` firstName) ++ " " ++
>     (obj `get` lastName)

Note that this function will accept any record
that has a @firstName@ and a @lastName@ field of
type @String@.

>>> displayName julian
Julian Fleischer

>>> displayName alexander
Alexander Carnicero

As mentioned above, records are first class citizens.
That means you can create them anywhere:

>>> displayName (firstName := "John" :+ lastName := "Doe")
John Doe

It is also possible to declare default values:

> name "serverName"
> name "port"
>
> record "ServerConfig"
>     `has` "serverName" := ''String := "localhost"
>     `has` "port"       := ''Int := (4711 :: Int)

>>> newServerConfig
serverName := "localhost" :+ port := 4711

>>> newServerConfig `set` serverName := "example.org"
serverName := "example.org" :+ port := 4711

>>> newServerConfig `get` port
4711

Complex expressions and types need to be quoted using
@[e| expr |]@ and @[t| type |]@ like so:

> record "Server"
>     `has` "requestHandler" := [t| Request -> Response |]
>                            := [e| \x -> answer x |]
>     `has` "config" := ''Config := [e| newConfig |]

It is furthermore possible to extend existing records
(but due to stage restrictions in GHCs implementation of
Template Haskell, two records of which one extends the other
can not be contained in the same module):

> module Sample2 where
>
> import Data.NamedRecord
> import Data.Word
>
> record "Account"
>     `has` "id"        := ''Word64
>
>     `has` "loginName" := ''String
>     `has` "password"  := ''String
>
> record "Person"
>     `has` "id"        := ''Word64
>
>     `has` "firstName" := ''String
>     `has` "lastName"  := ''String

> module Sample where
>
> import Data.NamedRecord
> import Data.Word
>
> import Sample2
>
> record "User"
>     `extends` __Person
>     `extends` __Account
>
>     `has` "id"           := ''Word64
>     `has` "emailAddress" := ''String

Named records allow you to define und use records

provides global name types and some syntactic sugar
to use them.

Here is a complete walk-through, with Template Haskell

This is how a typical example preamble looks like:

> import Data.NamedRecord

In order to use names you need to declare them first
(see the @names@ package for further details):

> name "firstName"
> name "lastName"

These are two records @Person@ and @User@:

> record "Person"
>     `has` "firstName" := ''String
>     `has` "lastName"  := ''String
>
> record "User"
>     `has` "firstName" := ''String
>     `has` "lastName"  := ''String
>     `has` "loginName" := ''String

Note that these declarations create constructor
functions @newPerson@ and @newUser@, as well as
type synonyms @Person@ and @User@ (use @-ddump-splices@
to see what has been generated).

Here are two instances of these recors:

> julian = newPerson
>    `set` firstName := "Julian"
>    `set` lastName  := "Fleischer"
>
> alexander = newUser
>    `set` firstName := "Alexander"
>    `set` lastName  := "Carnicero"
>    `set` loginName := "alexander.carnicero"

We can now create a @displayName@ function like
the following:

> displayName obj =
>     (obj `get` firstName) ++ " " ++
>     (obj `get` lastName)

Note that this function will accept any record
that has a @firstName@ and a @lastName@ field of
type @String@.

>>> displayName julian
Julian Fleischer

>>> displayName alexander
Alexander Carnicero

As mentioned above, records are first class citizens.
That means you can create them anywhere:

>>> displayName (firstName := "John" :+ lastName := "Doe")
John Doe

It is also possible to declare default values:

> name "serverName"
> name "port"
>
> record "ServerConfig"
>     `has` "serverName" := ''String := "localhost"
>     `has` "port"       := ''Int := (4711 :: Int)

>>> newServerConfig
serverName := "localhost" :+ port := 4711

>>> newServerConfig `set` serverName := "example.org"
serverName := "example.org" :+ port := 4711

>>> newServerConfig `get` port
4711

Complex expressions and types need to be quoted using
@[e| expr |]@ and @[t| type |]@ like so:

> record "Server"
>     `has` "requestHandler" := [t| Request -> Response |]
>                            := [e| \x -> answer x |]
>     `has` "config" := ''Config := [e| newConfig |]
