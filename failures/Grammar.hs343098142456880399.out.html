class Inflection α ⇒ NoCase α where
    noCase ∷ α → α
    hasNoCase ∷ α → Bool

-- | The ablative case (abbreviated abl) indicates movement from
-- something, or cause.
class Inflection α ⇒ Ablative α where
    ablative ∷ α → α
    isAblative ∷ α → Bool

-- | In linguistics, abessive (abbreviated abe or abess), caritive and privative
-- (abbreviated priv) are names for a grammatical case expressing the lack or
-- absence of the marked noun.
class Inflection α ⇒ Abessive α where
    abessive ∷ α → α
    isAbessive ∷ α → Bool

-- | The accusative case (abbreviated acc) indicates the direct object
-- of a verb.
class Inflection α ⇒ Accusative α where
    accusative ∷ α → α
    isAccusative ∷ α → Bool

-- | The comitative case (abbreviated com), also known as the associative case
-- (abbreviated ass), is a grammatical case that denotes companionship, and is
-- used where English would typically use preposition "with" in the sense of "in
-- company with" or "together with" (other uses of "with," e.g. with the meaning
-- of "using," "by means of" (I cut bread with a knife) would correspond to the
-- instrumental case or related cases).
class Inflection α ⇒ Comitative α where
    comitative ∷ α → α
    isComitative ∷ α → Bool

-- | The dative case (abbreviated dat, or sometimes d when it is a
-- core argument) indicates the indirect object of a verb.
class Inflection α ⇒ Dative α where
    dative ∷ α → α
    isDative ∷ α → Bool

-- | The delative case (abbreviated del; from Latin deferre "to bear or bring
-- away or down") in the Hungarian language can originally express the movement
-- from the surface of something (e.g. "off the table"), but it is used in
-- several other meanings (e.g. "about people"), some of them related to the
-- original (e.g. "from the post office").
class Inflection α ⇒ Delative α where
    delative ∷ α → α
    isDelative ∷ α → Bool

-- | The distributive case (abbreviated distr) is used on nouns for the meanings
-- of per or each.
class Inflection α ⇒ Distributive α where
    distributive ∷ α → α
    isDistributive ∷ α → Bool

-- | The distributive-temporal case specifies when something is done.
class Inflection α ⇒ DistributiveTemporal α where
    distributiveTemporal ∷ α → α
    isDistributiveTemporal ∷ α → Bool

-- | The essive or similaris case (abbreviated ess) carries the meaning of a
-- temporary location or state of being, often equivalent to the English "as a
-- (child)".
class Inflection α ⇒ Essive α where
    essive ∷ α → α
    isEssive ∷ α → Bool

-- | The genitive case (abbreviated gen; also called the possessive
-- case or second case), which roughly corresponds to English's
-- possessive case and preposition of, indicates the possessor of
-- another noun.
class Inflection α ⇒ Genitive α where
    genitive ∷ α → α
    isGenitive ∷ α → Bool

-- | The instrumental case (abbreviated ins or instr; also called the
-- eighth case) indicates an object used in performing an action.
class Inflection α ⇒ Instrumental α where
    instrumental ∷ α → α
    isInstrumental ∷ α → Bool

-- | In the Finnish language and Estonian language, the instructive case has the
-- basic meaning of "by means of". It is a comparatively rarely used case,
-- though it is found in some commonly used expressions, such as omin silmin →
-- "with one's own eyes".
class Inflection α ⇒ Instructive α where
    instructive ∷ α → α
    isInstructive ∷ α → Bool

-- | Lative (abbreviated lat) is a case which indicates motion to a location. It
-- corresponds to the English prepositions "to" and "into". The lative case
-- belongs to the group of the general local cases together with the locative
-- and separative case. The term derives from the Latin lat-, the participle
-- stem of ferre, "to bring".
class Inflection α ⇒ Lative α where
    lative ∷ α → α
    isLative ∷ α → Bool

-- | The locative case (abbreviated loc) indicates a location.
class Inflection α ⇒ Locative α where
    locative ∷ α → α
    isLocative ∷ α → Bool

-- | The multiplicative case is a grammatical case used for marking a number of
-- something ("three times").
class Inflection α ⇒ Multiplicative α where
    multiplicative ∷ α → α
    isMultiplicative ∷ α → Bool

-- | The nominative case (abbreviated nom) indicates the subject of a
-- finite verb.
class Inflection α ⇒ Nominative α where
    nominative ∷ α → α
    isNominative ∷ α → Bool

-- | The partitive case (abbreviated ptv or more ambiguously part)
-- denotes "partialness", "without result", or "without specific
-- identity". It is also used in contexts where a subgroup is selected
-- from a larger group, or with numbers.
class Inflection α ⇒ Partitive α where
    partitive ∷ α → α
    isPartitive ∷ α → Bool

    noCase :: α -> α
    hasNoCase :: α -> Bool

-- | The ablative case (abbreviated abl) indicates movement from
-- something, or cause.
class Inflection α => Ablative α where
    ablative :: α -> α
    isAblative :: α -> Bool

-- | In linguistics, abessive (abbreviated abe or abess), caritive and privative
-- (abbreviated priv) are names for a grammatical case expressing the lack or
-- absence of the marked noun.
class Inflection α => Abessive α where
    abessive :: α -> α
    isAbessive :: α -> Bool

-- | The accusative case (abbreviated acc) indicates the direct object
-- of a verb.
class Inflection α => Accusative α where
    accusative :: α -> α
    isAccusative :: α -> Bool

-- | The comitative case (abbreviated com), also known as the associative case
-- (abbreviated ass), is a grammatical case that denotes companionship, and is
-- used where English would typically use preposition "with" in the sense of "in
-- company with" or "together with" (other uses of "with," e.g. with the meaning
-- of "using," "by means of" (I cut bread with a knife) would correspond to the
-- instrumental case or related cases).
class Inflection α => Comitative α where
    comitative :: α -> α
    isComitative :: α -> Bool

-- | The dative case (abbreviated dat, or sometimes d when it is a
-- core argument) indicates the indirect object of a verb.
class Inflection α => Dative α where
    dative :: α -> α
    isDative :: α -> Bool

-- | The delative case (abbreviated del; from Latin deferre "to bear or bring
-- away or down") in the Hungarian language can originally express the movement
-- from the surface of something (e.g. "off the table"), but it is used in
-- several other meanings (e.g. "about people"), some of them related to the
-- original (e.g. "from the post office").
class Inflection α => Delative α where
    delative :: α -> α
    isDelative :: α -> Bool

-- | The distributive case (abbreviated distr) is used on nouns for the meanings
-- of per or each.

class Inflection α => DistributiveTemporal α where
    distributiveTemporal :: α -> α
    isDistributiveTemporal :: α -> Bool

-- | The essive or similaris case (abbreviated ess) carries the meaning of a
-- temporary location or state of being, often equivalent to the English "as a
-- (child)".
class Inflection α => Essive α where
    essive :: α -> α
    isEssive :: α -> Bool

-- | The genitive case (abbreviated gen; also called the possessive
-- case or second case), which roughly corresponds to English's
-- possessive case and preposition of, indicates the possessor of
-- another noun.

-- "with one's own eyes".
class Inflection α => Instructive α where
    instructive :: α -> α
    isInstructive :: α -> Bool

-- | Lative (abbreviated lat) is a case which indicates motion to a location. It
-- corresponds to the English prepositions "to" and "into". The lative case
-- belongs to the group of the general local cases together with the locative
-- and separative case. The term derives from the Latin lat-, the participle
-- stem of ferre, "to bring".
class Inflection α => Lative α where
    lative :: α -> α
    isLative :: α -> Bool

-- | The locative case (abbreviated loc) indicates a location.

-- | The multiplicative case is a grammatical case used for marking a number of
-- something ("three times").
class Inflection α => Multiplicative α where
    multiplicative :: α -> α
    isMultiplicative :: α -> Bool

-- | The nominative case (abbreviated nom) indicates the subject of a
-- finite verb.
class Inflection α => Nominative α where
    nominative :: α -> α
    isNominative :: α -> Bool

-- | The partitive case (abbreviated ptv or more ambiguously part)
-- denotes "partialness", "without result", or "without specific
-- identity". It is also used in contexts where a subgroup is selected
-- from a larger group, or with numbers.
class Inflection α => Partitive α where
    partitive :: α -> α
    isPartitive :: α -> Bool

-- | The Superessive case (abbreviated supe) is a grammatical declension

-- under an object. The sublative case is used in the Finnish, Tsez and
-- Hungarian languages.
