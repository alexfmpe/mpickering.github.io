-- Note that this function should not be used to express dependencies
-- between finalizers on 'ForeignPtr's.  For example, if the finalizer
-- for a 'ForeignPtr' @F1@ calls 'touchForeignPtr' on a second
-- 'ForeignPtr' @F2@, then the only guarantee is that the finalizer
-- for @F2@ is never started before the finalizer for @F1@.  They
-- might be started together if for example both @F1@ and @F2@ are
-- otherwise unreachable.
--
-- In general, it is not recommended to use finalizers on separate
-- objects with ordering constraints between them.  To express the
-- ordering robustly requires explicit synchronisation between
-- finalizers.
