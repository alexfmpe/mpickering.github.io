{-| This module provides a framework for creating a program that explores a tree
    in parallel. There are two families of functions that are available. The
    first is more general and allows you to construct your tree using arguments
    given on the command-line; they are described in the section linked to by
    "LogicGrowsOnTrees.Parallel.Main#main". If you do not need run-time
    information via a command-line argument to construct the tree, then you may
    prefer the simpler family of functions which are described in the section
    linked to by "LogicGrowsOnTrees.Parallel.Main#main-simple".

    All of this functionality is adapter independent, so if you want to use a
    different back end you only need to change the driver argument and
    recompile.

    just a map from 'DriverParameters' to @result_monad ()@, but involving a
    bunch of type variables and some constraints on them. It might be easier to
    click the link to go to the source.)

-------------------------------- Main functions --------------------------------
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

{- $main #main#
The functions in this section all provide a main function that starts up the
system that explores a tree in parallel using the given tree (constructed
possibly using information supplied on the command line) and the given adapter
provided via the driver argument.

All of the functionality of this module can be accessed through 'genericMain',
but we nonetheless also provide specialized versions of these functions for all
of the supported tree purities and exploration modes. This is done for two
reasons: first, in order to make the types more concrete to hopefully improve
usability, and second, because often the type of the tree is generalized so it
could be one of several types, and using a specialized function automatically
specializes the type rather than requiring a type annotation. The convention is
@mainForExploreTreeXY@ where @X@ is empty for pure trees, @IO@ for trees with
side-effects in the `IO` monad, and @Impure@ for trees with side-effects in some
general monad, and @Y@ specifies the exploration mode, which is empty for
'AllMode' (sum over all results), @UntilFirst@ for 'FirstMode' (stop when first
result found), @UntilFoundUsingPull@ for 'FoundModeUsingPull' (sum all results
until a condition has been met, only sending results to the supervisor upon
request) and @UntilFoundUsingPush@ for 'FoundModeUsingPush' (sum all results
until a condition has been met, pushing all found results immediately to the
supervisor).

If you do not need to use command-line arguments to construct the tree and don't
care about what the name of the program is on the help screen then you might be
interested in the simpler version of these functions in the following section
(follow "LogicGrowsOnTrees.Parallel.Main#main-simple").

    1. A solution is found, in which case a 'Just'-wrapped value is returned
       with both the found solution and the current 'Checkpoint', the latter
       allowing one to resume the search to look for more solutions later.

    2. The whole tree has been explored, in which case 'Nothing' is returned.

------------------- Stop when sum of results meets condition -------------------

{- $found #found#
The functions in this section are for when you want sum the results as you find
them until the sum matches a condition.  There are two versions of this mode,
based on whether one wants to regularly poll the workers for results or whether
one wants workers to immediately push every result to the supervisor as soon as
it is found.
 -}

{- $pull #pull#
In this mode, partial results are left on the workers until they receive either
a workload steal request or a progress update request. The advantage of this
approach is that it minimizes communication costs as partial results are sent on
an occasional basis rather than as soon as they are found. The downside of this
approach is that one has to poll the workers on a regular basis using a global
process update, and between polls it might be the case that the sum of all
results in the system meets the condition but this will not be found out until
the next poll, which wastes time equal to the amount of time between polls. If
you would rather have the system immediately terminate as soon as it has found
the desired results (at the price of paying an additional cost as each workload
is found in sending it to the supervisor), then follow
"LogicGrowsOnTrees.Parallel.Main#push" to see the description of push mode.

There are three ways in which a system running in this mode can terminate:

    1. A worker finds another result and now its (new) local sum meet the
       condition; in this case the sum of the worker's local sum and the
       supervisor's local sum is returned along with the current checkpoint
       (which allows the search to be resumed later to find more results), all
       wrapped in a 'Right'.

    2. The supervisor, having just received some new results from a worker, has
       its (new) local sum meet the condition; this has essentially the same
       effect as 1.

    3. The tree has been fully explored, in which case the full sum is returned
       in a 'Left'.

WARNING:  If you use this mode then you need to enable checkpointing when the
          program is run; if you do not do this, then you might end up in a
          situation where the sum of results over the entire system meets the
          condition but the system does not realize this because the results
          have not been gathered together and summed at the supervisor.

In this mode, whenever a result is found it is immediately sent to the
supervisor. The advantage of this approach is that the system finds out
immediately when all the results found so far have met the condition, rather
than waiting for a progress update to occur that gathers them together. The
downside of this approach is that it costs some time for a worker to send a
result to the supervisor, so if the condition will not be met until a large
number of results have been found then it be better let the workers accumulate
results locally and to poll them on a regular basis; to do this, follow
"LogicGrowsOnTrees.Parallel.Main#pull" to see the description of pull mode.

There are three ways in which a system running in this mode can terminate:

    1. The supervisor, having just received a new result from a worker, finds
       that its current sum meets the condition function, in which case it
       returns the sum as well as the current checkpoint (which allows the
       search to be resumed later to find more results) wrapped in a 'Right'.

    2. The tree has been fully explored, in which case the full sum is returned
       in a 'Left'.

(Note that, unlike the pull version, a partial result will not be returned upon
success as the Supervisor has access to all results and so it will never be in
the position of only having a partial result upon success.)

{-| This module provides a framework for creating a program that explores a tree
    in parallel. There are two families of functions that are available. The
    first is more general and allows you to construct your tree using arguments
    given on the command-line; they are described in the section linked to by
    "LogicGrowsOnTrees.Parallel.Main#main". If you do not need run-time
    information via a command-line argument to construct the tree, then you may
    prefer the simpler family of functions which are described in the section
    linked to by "LogicGrowsOnTrees.Parallel.Main#main-simple".

    All of this functionality is adapter independent, so if you want to use a
    different back end you only need to change the driver argument and
    recompile.

-------------------------------- Main functions --------------------------------
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

{- $main #main#
The functions in this section all provide a main function that starts up the
system that explores a tree in parallel using the given tree (constructed
possibly using information supplied on the command line) and the given adapter
provided via the driver argument.

All of the functionality of this module can be accessed through 'genericMain',
but we nonetheless also provide specialized versions of these functions for all
of the supported tree purities and exploration modes. This is done for two
reasons: first, in order to make the types more concrete to hopefully improve
usability, and second, because often the type of the tree is generalized so it
could be one of several types, and using a specialized function automatically
specializes the type rather than requiring a type annotation. The convention is
@mainForExploreTreeXY@ where @X@ is empty for pure trees, @IO@ for trees with
side-effects in the `IO` monad, and @Impure@ for trees with side-effects in some
general monad, and @Y@ specifies the exploration mode, which is empty for
'AllMode' (sum over all results), @UntilFirst@ for 'FirstMode' (stop when first
result found), @UntilFoundUsingPull@ for 'FoundModeUsingPull' (sum all results
until a condition has been met, only sending results to the supervisor upon
request) and @UntilFoundUsingPush@ for 'FoundModeUsingPush' (sum all results
until a condition has been met, pushing all found results immediately to the
supervisor).

If you do not need to use command-line arguments to construct the tree and don't

       with both the found solution and the current 'Checkpoint', the latter
       allowing one to resume the search to look for more solutions later.

    2. The whole tree has been explored, in which case 'Nothing' is returned.

------------------- Stop when sum of results meets condition -------------------

{- $found #found#
The functions in this section are for when you want sum the results as you find
them until the sum matches a condition.  There are two versions of this mode,
based on whether one wants to regularly poll the workers for results or whether
one wants workers to immediately push every result to the supervisor as soon as
it is found.
 -}

{- $pull #pull#
In this mode, partial results are left on the workers until they receive either
a workload steal request or a progress update request. The advantage of this
approach is that it minimizes communication costs as partial results are sent on
an occasional basis rather than as soon as they are found. The downside of this
approach is that one has to poll the workers on a regular basis using a global
process update, and between polls it might be the case that the sum of all
results in the system meets the condition but this will not be found out until
the next poll, which wastes time equal to the amount of time between polls. If
you would rather have the system immediately terminate as soon as it has found
the desired results (at the price of paying an additional cost as each workload
is found in sending it to the supervisor), then follow
"LogicGrowsOnTrees.Parallel.Main#push" to see the description of push mode.

There are three ways in which a system running in this mode can terminate:

    1. A worker finds another result and now its (new) local sum meet the
       condition; in this case the sum of the worker's local sum and the
       supervisor's local sum is returned along with the current checkpoint
       (which allows the search to be resumed later to find more results), all
       wrapped in a 'Right'.

    2. The supervisor, having just received some new results from a worker, has
       its (new) local sum meet the condition; this has essentially the same
       effect as 1.

    3. The tree has been fully explored, in which case the full sum is returned
       in a 'Left'.

WARNING:  If you use this mode then you need to enable checkpointing when the
          program is run; if you do not do this, then you might end up in a
          situation where the sum of results over the entire system meets the
          condition but the system does not realize this because the results
          have not been gathered together and summed at the supervisor.

{- $push #push#
In this mode, whenever a result is found it is immediately sent to the
supervisor. The advantage of this approach is that the system finds out
immediately when all the results found so far have met the condition, rather
than waiting for a progress update to occur that gathers them together. The
downside of this approach is that it costs some time for a worker to send a
result to the supervisor, so if the condition will not be met until a large
number of results have been found then it be better let the workers accumulate
results locally and to poll them on a regular basis; to do this, follow
"LogicGrowsOnTrees.Parallel.Main#pull" to see the description of pull mode.

There are three ways in which a system running in this mode can terminate:

    1. The supervisor, having just received a new result from a worker, finds
       that its current sum meets the condition function, in which case it
       returns the sum as well as the current checkpoint (which allows the
       search to be resumed later to find more results) wrapped in a 'Right'.

    2. The tree has been fully explored, in which case the full sum is returned
       in a 'Left'.

(Note that, unlike the pull version, a partial result will not be returned upon
success as the Supervisor has access to all results and so it will never be in
the position of only having a partial result upon success.)
