{-
it might make seem straightforward to define the following class that
corresponds to other transformer classes. But while we can define the the
class and its instances, there is a problem we try to use it, assuming that we
do not want to annotate the full type signature of the config:
  the type of the config can not be inferred properly. we would need a feature
  like "infer, as return type for this function, the only type for
  which there exists a valid chain of instance definitions that is needed to
  by this function".
  In other words, it is impossible to use the mAskRaw function without
  binding a concrete type for c, because otherwise the inference runs into
  some overlapping instances.
For this reason, I removed this type class and created a non-class function
mAskRaw, for which the type inference works because it involves no
type classes.
