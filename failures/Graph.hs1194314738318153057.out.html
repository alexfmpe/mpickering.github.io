-- In "Term" a little SKI term parser is given. The code below implements a small compiler that translates the abstract syntax tree into a graph. Here you can see how primitive graph transformation functions like 'newNode' and 'newEdge' can be used to build a graph inside the 'GraphRewriting.Graph.Rewrite' monad. Also it shows how an edge can be attached to a node's port, simply by assigning it to the corresponding record field.
