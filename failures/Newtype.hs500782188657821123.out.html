The 'Newtype' typeclass and related functions: 'op', 'ala', 'ala'', 'under'.
Primarly pulled from Conor McBride's Epigram work. Some examples:

@ala Sum foldMap [1,2,3,4] -- foldMaps the list ala the Sum newtype. This results in 10.@

@ala Product foldMap [1,2,3,4] -- foldMaps the list ala the Product newtype. This results in 24.@

@ala Endo foldMap [(+1), (+2), (subtract 1), (*2)] 3 -- foldMaps the list ala the Endo newtype. This results in 8.@

NB: 'Data.Foldable.foldMap' is a generalized @mconcatMap@ which is a generalized @concatMap@.

This package includes 'Newtype' instances for all the (non-GHC\/foreign)
newtypes in base (as seen in the examples).
However, there are neat things you can do with this with
/any/ newtype and you should definitely define your own 'Newtype'
instances for the power of this library.
For example, see @ala Cont traverse@, with the proper 'Newtype' instance for Cont.
You can easily define new instances for your newtypes with the help of GHC.Generics

 > {—# LANGUAGE DeriveGeneric #—}
 > import GHC.Generics
 >
 > (...)
 > newtype Example = Example Int {deriving Generic)
 >
 > instance Newtype Example

This avoids the use of Template Haskell (TH) to get new instances.
