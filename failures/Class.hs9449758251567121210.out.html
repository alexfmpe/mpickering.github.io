[Computation type:] Computations which read values from a shared environment.

[Binding strategy:] Monad values are functions from the environment to a value.
The bound function is applied to the bound value, and both have access
to the shared environment.

[Useful for:] Maintaining variable bindings, or other shared environment.

[Zero and plus:] None.

[Example type:] @'Reader' [(String,Value)] a@

The 'Reader' monad (also called the Environment monad).
Represents a computation, which can read values from
a shared environment, pass values from function to function,
and execute sub-computations in a modified environment.
Using 'Reader' monad for such computations is often clearer and easier
than using the 'Control.Monad.State.State' monad.
