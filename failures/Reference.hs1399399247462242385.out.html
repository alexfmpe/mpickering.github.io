Module      :  Control.Comonad.Sheet.Reference
Description :  Relative and absolute references to locations in arbitrary-dimensional sheets.

This module defines the types needed to construct and manipulate references to locations in n-dimensional sheets.
All sheets support relative references, but only 'Indexed' sheets support absolute references; the type system prevents
the use of absolute references for sheets without an index.
