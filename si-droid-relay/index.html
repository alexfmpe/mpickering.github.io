        <h1> Instructions </h1>
        <p>
        If you have found yourself running a relay competition using SIDroid
        then you will be aware that it is difficult to process the result afterwards.
        </p>

        <p>
        This application will process a results file as provide by SIDroid and
        so that it is suitable to be uploaded to SplitsBrowser.
        </p>

        <p>
        Two files are uploaded - the teams description file and the SplitsBrowser
        file outputted by SIDroid. The program will then modify the SplitsBrowser file
        to set the correct split times. It can also produce a results table
        (in csv format) which can be displayed to show the overall results.
        </p>

        <p>
        The format of the team description file is a CSV file with the following
        format.
        </p>

        <p>
        <code>
          Team Number, Team Name, [SICard, Forename, Surname, Club, Class]
        </code>
        </p>

        <p>
        The final set of three columns is repeated for the number of legs the
        relay has. It is permitted to repeat names and SICard numbers (which
        is one of the reasons you might want to use SIDroid rather than
        AutoDownload).
        </p>

        <p>
        Firstly, you should press the "Make Entry List" button to
        generate a list of entries from this team description file. The
        results processing expects the results to be in a certain format so you
        must do this. You can then import this file into SIDroid to populate
        the entry list.
        </p>

        <p>
        Then, run your event as normal. The results will look incorrect as people
        download as the start time of the kth leg runner will not be automatically
        set to the end time of the previous runner. This is what the program
        fixes. Export your results as a "SportsIdent CSV"
        </p>

        <p>
        Finally, upload the splits.csv file as created by SIDroid and then
        click the appropiate button to generate a table or normalised SplitsBrowser file.
        When you upload it to SplitsBrowser, the format is "SportsIdent CSV".
